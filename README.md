# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13 for UT Bootcamp - API, JS, Leaflet, and GeoJSON

# Repository Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to house files for the Module 13 Exercises and Challenge.

The folder `Earthquake_Challenge` contains the code and files for the graded portion of Module 13. The other folders were exercises completed as part of the unit.

The challenge consisted of making an interactive webpage that shows the location and magnitude of recent earthwuakes along with location of Tectonic Plates. The webpage features three possible background maps. In the upper right corner, the user can click the layers button and then change between different background maps and turn any of the three layers on or off with checkboxes. This allows the user to easily visualize how earthquakes are related to Tectonic plates that form the Earth's crust.
